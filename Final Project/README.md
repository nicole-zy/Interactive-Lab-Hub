# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project Github page set up - May 3

Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12

Final Project Documentation due - May 19



## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing. 

## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process

We’ve created a DDR game. The easy setting is gentle enough for toddlers to play, so if they are just beginning to learn their directional signs. We’ve used sensors and the wires to facilitate capacitive touch, and we make use of the text to speech to have a voice read out the instructions, and let you know how well you are doing in the game. We’ve modeled this against the popular dance dance revolution games seen at many arcades. Only our version is the finger version, instead of the full body dance version. Players get three lives - once they hit three wrong moves, the game is over.

2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)

3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)

We are demoing the one player version here - but the two player mode allows two players to rally against each other. 
Here is the demo in action.https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Im6LzqkTqIcfEQMOxO5LTp1bfeqlAMs/view?usp=drivesdk

4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
